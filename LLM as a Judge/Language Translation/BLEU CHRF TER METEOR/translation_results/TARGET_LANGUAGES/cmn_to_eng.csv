371,在吃树干之前，三角龙会用它强有力的喙嘴剥去树叶。,"Before eating the tree, the dragon will use it strongly to pluck the leaves of the tree."
372,其他科学家认为这些植物有毒，所以恐龙不太可能吃它们，即便现在树懒和其他动物例如鹦鹉（恐龙的后代）可以吃有毒的叶子或水果。,"Other scientists believe these plants are poisonous, so dinosaurs are unlikely to eat them, even now trees and other animals such as dinosaurs' descendants can eat poisonous leaves or fruits."

374,一个在地球上重 200 磅（90公斤）的人，在木卫一上的重量约为 36 磅（16公斤）。因此重力理所当然地对你产生了较小的牵引力。,"A person who weighs 200 pounds on earth, weighs about 36 pounds on a tree."
375,太阳并没有像地球那样可以站在上面的地壳。整个太阳是由气体、火和等离子体组成的。,"太阳没有像地球一样可以站在上面的地──The entire Sun is composed of gases, fires and other particles──"
376,当你距离太阳中心越远，气体就越稀薄。,"When you're farther away from the Sun, the air is thinner."
377,我们看到的太阳外部称作光球层，意即“光之球”。,"We see the sun outside called as the light globe layer, meaning the light globe."
378,约三千年后，也就是在1610年，意大利的天文学家伽利略·伽利莱（Galileo Galilei）使用望远镜观测天体，发现金星具有着与月球一致的相位。,"About three millennia later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used telescopes to observe the heavens, and discovered that the golden stars had positions consistent with the moon."
379,相变的发生是因为金星（或月球）只有面向太阳的一边被照到。金星的相变支持了哥白尼的理论，即行星围绕太阳旋转。,"Changes occurred because only one side facing the Sun was noticed. Changes in the stars supported the theory of Copernicus, that planets rotate around the Sun."
380,然后，几年后的 1639 年，一位名叫耶利米·霍罗克斯 (Jeremiah Horrocks) 的英国天文学家观测到了一次金星凌日。,"Then, a few years later, in 1639, a British astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a one-time golden star."
381,重新征服丹麦法区域 (Danelaw) 后，英格兰经历了很长的和平时期。,"After conquering the Dan麦法地区 (Danelaw), England experienced a long period of peace."
382,然而，在 991 年，埃塞尔雷德面对的是一个世纪前的古斯鲁姆舰队之后最大的维京舰队。,"However, in 991, Eselred faced the largest Viking fleet after the Austro-Hungarian fleet a century earlier."
383,这支舰队由奥拉夫·特里格瓦松率领。他是挪威人，志在将挪威从丹麦手中夺回来。,This fleet was led by Olaf Trigvason. He was a Norwegian who wanted to retake Norway from Denmark.
384,在初期军事失利之后，埃塞尔雷德终于与奥拉夫达成协议，奥拉夫重返挪威试图夺回王位，但算不上成功。,"After the initial military defeat, Eserred finally reached an agreement with Olaf, and Olaf returned to Norway to try to regain the throne, but was unsuccessful."
385,韩文字母是唯一一个特意发明供日常使用的字母表，是于 1444 年世宗皇帝（1418 - 1450）统治时期所发明的。,韩文字母 (韩文字母) is the only specialized typeface invented for everyday use. It was invented in 1444 during the reign of Emperor Zheng Zheng.
386,世宗大王为朝鲜王朝的第四任君主，也是最受推崇的君主之一。,"世宗大王 was the fourth emperor of the Korean dynasty, and one of the most revered emperors."
387,他最初将韩语字母发音表命名为“训民正音”，意思是“用于教导人民的正确发音”。,"He originally named the Korean alphabet pronunciation program 训民正音, which means to teach people's correct pronunciation──."
388,关于梵语的起源有很多说法。其中之一是雅利安人从西方移民到印度，将自己的语言带到这里。,"There are many sayings about the origin of the language. One of them is the arrival of the Aryans from the West to India, bringing their own language here."
389,梵语是一种古老的语言，能与欧洲的拉丁语相媲美。,"语 is an ancient language, which can be compared to the Latin language of Europe."
390,世界上已知最早的书是用梵文写的。《奥义书》编撰完成后，梵文由于等级制度的原因逐渐消失。,"The earliest known books in the world were written in the language of 文. After the completion of the writing of 义书, 文 due to the gradual disappearance of the hierarchy system."
391,梵语是一种博大精深的语言，也是许多现代印度语的起源，就像拉丁语是法语和西班牙语等欧洲语言的起源一样。,"语 is a rich language, also the origin of many modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the origin of European languages such as French and Spanish."
392,对法作战结束后，德国又开始为入侵不列颠岛做准备。,"After the end of the war, Germany again began preparations for the invasion of the British Isles."
393,德国将此次袭击的代号定为“海狮行动”。英国军队从敦刻尔克撤退时失去了大部分重型武器和补给，元气大伤。,The German army lost most of its heavy weapons and supplies when it withdrew from the city.
394,但皇家海军还是比德国海军（“Kriegsmarine”）强得多，可以摧毁任何跨越英吉利海峡的入侵舰队。,"But the Royal Navy is still stronger than the German Navy, capable of destroying any invading fleet across the English Channel."
395,然而，很少有皇家海军舰艇在潜在的入侵路线附近驻扎，因为海军将领们担心舰艇会被德国的空袭击沉。,"However, very few Royal Navy ships are stationed near potential invasion routes, as Navy leaders fear the ships will be hit by German airstrikes."
396,让我们先来解释一下意大利的计划。意大利基本上属于德国和日本的“小兄弟”。,让我们先来解释一下意大利的计划──意大利 essentially belongs to the 小兄弟── of Germany and Japan.
397,该国陆军和海军都比较弱，尽管他们在战争开始前不久建造了四艘新舰船。,"The country's army and navy were weaker, although they built four new ships shortly before the war began."
398,意大利的主要目标是非洲国家。为了夺取这些国家，他们需要一个军队基地，以便军队可以驶穿地中海，入侵非洲。,"Italy's main objective is to conquer these countries, they need an army base so that the army can cross the Mediterranean and invade Africa."
399,为此，他们不得不将英国在埃及的基地和船舰撤出。除了采取这些行动，意大利的战舰本不应该有所行动。,"For this reason, they had to withdraw British bases and ships from Egypt. In addition to taking these actions, Italian warships should not have taken any action."
400,现在来看日本。和英国一样，日本是一个岛国。,"现在来看日本──和英国一样,Japan is an island country──"
401,潜水艇是为了在水底下行驶而设计的船，而且潜水艇在水面下停留的时间较长。,"Submarine boats are designed to operate underwater, and submarine boats stay underwater for longer periods of time."
402,第一次世界大战和第二次世界大战期间都使用了潜水艇。 那时它们的速度很慢，射击范围也非常有限。,"During World War I and World War II, both submarines were used. At the time, their speed was very slow, and their range of fire was very limited."
403,在战争开始时，它们大多在海面上航行，但随着雷达的发展和精确度的提高，潜艇被迫潜入水下以免被发现。,"At the beginning of the war, they mostly sailed on the sea surface, but with the development of radar and improved accuracy, submarines were forced to dive underwater to avoid detection."
404,德国潜艇被称为 U 型潜艇。德国人非常擅长导航和操作潜艇。,德国潜艇 is known as U 型潜艇──德国人非常擅长导航和操作潜艇──
405,由于德国人在潜艇方面很成功，他们在战后不获托管大量潜艇。,"Because the Germans were very successful in submarines, they did not receive a large number of submarines after the war."
406,是的！图坦卡蒙国王，有时也被称为“图特王”或“少年国王”，他是现代最著名的古埃及国王之一。,"Tutankhamun King, sometimes also called Tutankhamun King or Young King, was one of the most prominent ancient Egyptian kings of modern times."
407,有趣的是，他在古代并不被认为是举足轻重的人物，而且不被记录于大多数古代国王的名单。,"Interestingly, he was not considered an important figure in antiquity, nor was he recorded in most ancient kings' lists."
408,然而，1922 年发现了他的墓穴，让他成了名人。虽然有许多过去的坟墓被盗，但这座坟墓几乎未遭破坏。,"However, in 1922 his tomb was discovered, making him a celebrity. Although many of his former tombs were stolen, the tomb was virtually untouched."
409,图坦卡蒙的大部分陪葬品都保存完好，其中包括数千件由贵金属和稀有宝石制成的文物。,"The bulk of Tutankhamun's burial goods are well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare precious stones."
410,辐轮的发明使亚述人的战车更轻便、更迅速，行驶起来可以更轻松地超过士兵和其他战车。,"The invention of the radiator made the war cars of the Assyrians easier, faster, and easier to ride than soldiers and other war vehicles."
411,他们从致命的十字弓中射出的利箭，能穿透敌军的盔甲。公元前 1000 年前后，亚述人使用了第一批骑兵。,"They fired arrows from deadly crossbows, capable of penetrating enemy armies' armour."
412,骑兵是指在马背上作战的军队。当时尚未发明马鞍，因此亚述骑兵只能骑在光秃秃的马背上作战。,"Cavalry refers to an army that fights on horseback. At the time, horses had not yet been invented, so Cavalry could only fight on light horses."
413,我们知道许多希腊政治家、科学家和艺术家。希腊文化中最有名的人可能是有着传奇色彩的盲人诗人荷马。他创作了希腊文学的两部杰作：《伊利亚特》和《奥德赛》。,"We know of many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. The most famous person in Greek culture is probably the legendary colored blind poet Homer. He composed two masterpieces of Greek literature: 伊利亚特 and 奥德赛."
414,索福克勒斯（Sophocles ）和阿里斯托芬（Aristophanes）仍然是受欢迎的剧作家，他们的戏剧被认为是世界文学中最伟大的作品之一。,"Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular playwrights, and their plays are considered one of the greatest works of world literature."
415,另一个著名的希腊人是数学家毕达哥拉斯，他最有名的成就是提出了关于直角三角形各边关系的著名定理。,"Another prominent Greek was the mathematician Pythagoras, best known for proposing the famous theorem of right triangle relations."
416,对于说印地语的人口数，有不同的说法。据估计，印地语是世界上第二到第四最常用的语言。,"According to estimates, Hindi is the world's second to fourth most commonly spoken language."
417,母语人数取决于紧密相关的方言是否计算在内。,The number of mother tongues depends on whether the closely related dictionaries are calculated within.
418,据估计，会说这种语言的人数量范围在 3.4 亿到 5 亿之间，而能听懂这种语言的人则多达 8 亿。,"It is estimated that the number of people who speak this language ranges between 3.4 billion and 5 billion, while the number of people who can understand this language is up to 8 billion."
419,印度语和乌尔都语有着相似的词汇，但文字的书写方式不同；在日常对话中，这两种语言通常可以交流互通。,"Hindi and Urdu languages have similar vocabulary, but different writing styles; in everyday conversations, these two languages can usually communicate with each other."
420,15 世纪前后，爱沙尼亚北部深受德国文化的影响。,"In the 15th century, northern Estonia was heavily influenced by German culture."
421,一些德国修道士想让上帝更接近本国人，所以他们发明了爱沙尼亚文字语言。,"Some German monks wanted to make God closer to their people, so they invented the written language of Estonia."
422,它是在德语字母表中加了一个字母“Õ/õ”。,It is written in German with a letter Õ/õ。
423,随着时间的推移，许多德语外来词与原有词汇合并。这就是启蒙运动的开始。,"With the passage of time, many German foreign words came together with the original words. This was the beginning of the Enlightenment movement."
424,传统上，王位继承人在完成学业后会直接入伍。,"Traditionally, the heir to the throne will be directly inducted into the army after completing his studies."
425,不过，查尔斯入读了剑桥大学三一学院，他在那里学习了人类学和考古学，后来又学习了历史学，获得了 2:2 学位（二等二学位）。,"However, Charles entered Cambridge University's Trinity College, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and later studied history, obtaining a 2:2 学位 (second grade) degree."
426,查尔斯是第一个获得学位的英国王室成员。,Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to obtain a degree.
427,土耳其位于欧洲的部分（地处巴尔干半岛的东色雷斯或鲁米利亚）占其国土面积的 3％。,"Turkey is located in the eastern part of the Balkan Peninsula, occupying 3% of the country's land area."
428,"土耳其领土长 1,600 多公里（1,000 英里），宽 800 公里（500 英里），大致呈矩形。","Turkish territory length 1,600 多公里(1,000 英里), width 800 公里(500 英里),"
429,"土耳其的国土面积（包括湖泊）为 783,562 平方公里（300,948 平方英里），其中 755,688 平方公里（291,773 平方英里）位于西南亚，23,764 平方公里（9,174 平方英里）位于欧洲。",Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur Tur
430,土耳其的面积在世界上排第 37 位，大约是法国本土和英国面积的总和。,"The area of Turkey is ranked 37th in the world, roughly the sum of the area of the French mainland and the UK."
431,土耳其三面环海：西面是爱琴海，北面是黑海，南面则是地中海。,"Turkey's three faces are the Mediterranean Sea, the north is the Black Sea and the south is the Mediterranean Sea."
432,卢森堡历史悠久，但在 1839 年才独立成国。,"Luxembourg has a long history, but only became an independent country in 1839."
433,今天的比利时有部分地区过去属于卢森堡，但在 19 世纪 30 年代的比利时革命后被划入比利时。,"Some parts of present-day Belgium have belonged to Luxembourg, but were ceded to Belgium after the 19th- and 30th-century Belgian Revolution."
434,卢森堡一直试图成为中立国，但它在第一次世界大战和第二次世界大战中都曾被德国占领。,"Luxembourg has always tried to become a neutral country, but it was occupied by Germany during World War I and World War II."
435,1957 年，卢森堡成为如今被称为欧盟的组织的创始成员国。,"In 1957, Luxembourg became a founding member of what is now known as the European Union."
436,朱克杰宗（Drukgyal Dzong）是一座已毁的堡垒和佛教寺庙，位于帕罗区上部（在方德村）。,"朱克杰宗 (Drukgyal Dzong) is a ruined fortress and Buddhist temple, located in the upper part of the Paro district."
437,据说扎布隆·阿旺·纳姆耶尔 (Zhabdrung nawang Namgyel) 于 1649 年建造这座堡垒，是为了纪念自己战胜藏蒙军队。,"According to Zhabdrung nawang Namgyel, this fortress was built in 1649 to commemorate his victory over the Mongol army."
438,1951 年，一场大火导致杜克耶堡仅存一丝遗迹，例如扎布隆·阿旺·纳姆格亚尔（Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal）的雕像。,"In 1951, a major fire caused only a fragment of the ruins to be left behind, such as the statue of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal (Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal)."
439,火灾过后，堡垒得到维护和保护，成为不丹最备受瞩目的景点之一。,"After the fire, the fortress was maintained and protected, becoming one of the most popular tourist attractions in Bhutan."
440,18 世纪的柬埔寨被夹在泰国和越南两个强邻之间。,"In the 18th century, Cambodia was divided between Thailand and Vietnam."
441,泰国人在 18 世纪曾多次入侵柬埔寨，并在 1772 年摧毁了金边。,"The Thai people invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century, and destroyed the country in 1772."
442,在 18 世纪的最后几年，越南人也入侵了柬埔寨。,"In the last few years of the 18th century, the Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia."
443,百分之十八的委内瑞拉人失业，而大部分就业者是非正规经济从业人员。,"百分之十八委内瑞拉人失业, while the majority of those employed are illegal economic practitioners."
444,三分之二的委内瑞拉人就是这样从事服务行业，接近四分之一的人从事工业，五分之一的人在农业行业里工作。,"Three-quarters of the Venezuelan population is engaged in the service sector, nearly one-quarter is engaged in industry, and one-fifth is engaged in agriculture."
445,委内瑞拉是石油净出口国，尽管只有百分之一的人在石油行业工作，但石油行业仍然是该国的重要产业。,"Venezuela is a net oil exporter, although only one percent of the population works in the oil industry, but the oil industry is still an important industry in the country."
446,在国家独立初期，新加坡植物园发挥其专业知识所长，帮助该岛成为了一座热带“花园城市”。,"In the early days of the country's independence, the Singapore Botanical Garden developed its expertise, helping the island become a hot spring garden city."
447,1981 年，卓锦万代兰被选为该国的国花。它是兰花的杂交品种。,"In 1981, the family was chosen as the national flower of the country."
448,每年 10 月前后，大约有 150 万只食草动物从北部山区出发，穿过马拉河，前往雨水充足的南部平原。,"Every year after October, about 1.5 million herbivorous animals depart from the northern mountainous region, through the Mara River, to the rain-filled southern plains."
449,然后，在四月左右的雨季之后，从西部回到北部，再次穿越马拉河。,"Then, after the rainy season of April or so, from the west back to the north, again across the Mara River."
450,塞伦盖蒂（Serengeti）地区包括塞伦盖蒂（Serengeti ）国家公园、坦桑尼亚的恩戈罗恩戈罗（Ngorongoro）自然保护区、马斯瓦（Maswa）野生动物保护区以及肯尼亚的马赛马拉（Maasai Mara）国家保护区。,塞伦盖蒂(Serengeti) 地区包括塞伦盖蒂(Serengeti) 国家公园、坦桑尼亚的恩戈罗恩戈罗(Ngorongoro) 自然保护区、马斯瓦(Maswa) 野生动物保护区以及肯尼亚的马赛马拉(马赛马拉) 国家保护区──
451,学习制作互动媒体需要常规传统技能，以及在互动课程中掌握的工具（故事板制作、音频和视频编辑、故事情节设计等）。,"Learning to produce interactive media requires conventional traditional skills, as well as tools mastered in interactive courses (storyboard production, audio and video editing, story story story design, etc.)."
452,交互设计要求你重新评估有关媒体制作的假设，并学会非线性思考。,"交互设计 requires you to reassess assumptions about media production,并学会非线性思考──"
453,交互设计要求项目的各个组成部分相互联系，但也可以作为一个独立实体存在。,"交互设计要求项目各组成部分相互联系, but can also exist as an independent entity."
454,变焦镜头的缺点是，要想实现一定的焦距范围，所需的焦距复杂度和透镜元件的数量远远大于定焦镜头。,"变焦镜的缺点是, in order to achieve a certain focal length, the required focal length complexity and the number of lens elements is far greater than the fixed focal length."
455,随着镜头制造商在镜头生产方面达到更高的标准，这已经不算什么问题了。,"As mirror manufacturers reach higher standards in mirror production, this is no longer a problem."
456,这使得变焦镜头可以拍出与固定焦距镜头质量相媲美的照片。,This allows the focused mirror to take pictures of the quality of the fixed-focus mirror.
457,变焦镜头的另一个缺点是镜头的最大光圈（速度）通常较小。,Another shortcoming of the 变焦镜头 is the maximum light circle of the mirror (speed) usually smaller.
458,这使得廉价的变焦镜头在没有闪光灯的情况下很难在弱光条件下使用。,This makes it difficult to use in low light conditions in the absence of flashlights.
459,在尝试将电影转换成 DVD 格式时，最常见的问题之一是过度扫描。,"When trying to convert movies to DVD format, one of the most common problems is over-scaning."
460,大多数电视节目都是为娱乐大众而制作的。,Most TV shows are produced for entertainment purposes.
461,出于该原因，你在电视上看到的画面边框，包括顶部、底部和侧边，都被裁剪了。,"For this reason, the edges of the screen you see on TV, including the top, bottom and sides, are cut off."
462,这样做是为了保证图像能覆盖住整个屏幕。这叫做“过度扫描”。,This is done to ensure that the image can cover the entire screen.
463,遗憾的是，当你制作 DVD 时，它的边框很可能也会被裁剪掉，而且如果视频中的字幕太靠近底部，那么字幕也会显示不完整。,"Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, its edge is likely to be cut off, and if the subtitle in the video is too close to the bottom, then the subtitle will also show incomplete."
464,这座传统的中世纪城堡长久以来一直激发着人们的想象力，让人联想到马背长矛比武、宴会和亚瑟王骑士精神的画面。,"This traditional medieval castle has long inspired people's imagination, letting people think of the images of horses riding spears, feasts and the spirit of King Arthur's Knights."
465,人们即使站在千年的废墟中，也很容易回想起早已逝去的战争的声音和气味，几乎能听到鹅卵石上马蹄的碰撞声，也能闻到从地牢坑里冒出来的恐惧气息。,"People, even standing in the ruins of a thousand years, can easily recall the sounds and smells of the ancient wars, can almost hear the clashes of horses on the rocks, and can sense the fearful atmosphere that emerges from the trenches."
466,但是我们的想象有现实依据吗？最初为什么要建城堡？它们是如何设计和建造的？,But is our imagination based on reality? Why did we build castles in the first place? How were they designed and built?
467,作为那段时期的典型建筑，与其说克尔比墨斯鲁（Muxloe）城堡是一座真正的城堡，不如说它是一座加固的房屋。,"As a typical architecture of that period, in contrast to the Kálbi墨斯鲁 (Muxloe) castle, it is a real castle, not to say that it is a fortified house."
468,它的大玻璃窗和薄墙不可能长时间抵抗得住一次坚决的攻击。,Its large glass windows and thin walls could not withstand a decisive attack for a long time.
469,15 世纪 80 年代，在黑斯廷斯勋爵（Lord Hastings）开始建造这座城堡的时候，这个国家还相对和平，只需要防御一小群四处游荡的抢掠者。,"In the 15th century 80s, when Lord Hastings began to build this castle, the country was still relatively peaceful, needing only to defend a small group of wandering plunderers."
470,权力的平衡是欧洲国家寻求维护全体欧洲国家国家主权的制度。,The balance of power is the system of sovereignty of all European countries.
471,这种理念是，所有欧洲国家必须设法阻止某个国家/地区独自变得强大，因此，各国政府为了保持平衡经常更换盟友。,"This idea is that all European countries must try to prevent a country/region from becoming stronger on its own, hence, in order to maintain balance, governments regularly exchange allies."
472,西班牙继承权之战标志着第一场以权力平衡为核心问题的战争。,The War of Spanish Succession marked the first war on balance of power as a central issue.
473,这标志着一个重要的变化，因为欧洲大国将无法再以宗教战争为借口。因此，三十年战争将是最后一场被贴上宗教战争标签的战争。,"This marks an important change, as the great powers of Europe will no longer be able to use religious warfare as a pretext."
474,公元前 356 年 7 月 21 日，赫洛斯塔图斯 (Herostratus) 的纵火行为导致位于以弗所 (Ephesus) 的阿尔忒弥斯神庙毁于一旦。,"BC 356 year July 21 日, the burning behavior of Herosstatus (Herostratus) led to the destruction of the Almighty God in Ephesus (Ephesus)."
475,据故事情节所写，此人愿不惜一切代价出人头地。愤慨的以弗所人宣布黑若斯达特斯（Herostratus）之名罄竹难书。,"According to the storyline, this person is willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of humanity."
476,希腊历史学家斯特拉博 (Strabo) 后来提到了这个名字，也就是我们今天所熟知的名字。圣殿在亚历山大大帝出生的当晚被毁。,"The Greek historian Strabo later mentioned this name, which is the name we know today."
477,亚历山大大帝原本提议重建这座神庙，但其提案遭到拒绝。随后，在亚历山大死后，该神庙于公元前 323 年得以重建。,"Alexander the Great originally proposed rebuilding the temple, but his proposal was rejected. Later, after Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC."
478,确保你的手尽可能地放松，同时仍可以正确地敲击所有的音符—手指也尽量不要做太多无关的动作。,"Make sure your hands are as loose as possible, while still being able to correctly tap all the notes and fingers and try not to do too many unrelated movements."
479,这样就能让你尽可能节省体力。记住，不用像在钢琴上那样用力敲击琴键来提升音量。,"This will allow you to save as much energy as possible. Remember, you don't have to use the power of the piano to raise the volume."
480,为了提高手风琴的音量，可以更用力或以更快的速度拉风箱。,"In order to improve the volume of the hand wind instrument, you can use more power or at a faster speed."
481,神秘主义追求与终极现实、神性、精神真理或上帝进行交流、认同或达成知觉意识。,"The pursuit of mysticism is to communicate with the ultimate reality, the nature, spiritual truth, or God, acknowledging or achieving conscious awareness."
482,信徒们寻求一种对神圣的现实/神性或诸神的直接体验、直觉或者顿悟。,Believers seek a direct experience of the divine reality/deity or of the gods.
483,追随者追求某种生活方式或旨在滋养这些经验的修行。,Followers pursue a certain way of life or practice designed to nurture these experiences.
484,神秘主义可以与其他形式的宗教信仰和崇拜区分开来，因为它强调对独特意识状态的个人直接体验，特别是那些和平的、有洞察力的、幸福的、甚至是狂喜的意识状态。,"Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious belief and worship, because it emphasizes direct personal experience of a unique state of consciousness, especially those of peaceful, insightful, happy, or even insane consciousness."
485,锡克教是来自印度次大陆的一种宗教。它在 15 世纪起源于旁遮普地区，来自印度教传统的内部宗派分裂。,"Sikhism is a religion from the Indian subcontinent. It originated in the 15th century in the Punjab region, from the internal sectarian division of the Hindu tradition."
486,锡克教徒认为，他们信仰的是与印度教不同的一种宗教，尽管他们承认锡克教源自印度教，也包含印度教的传统。,"Sikhs believe that their faith is a different religion from Hinduism, although they acknowledge that Sikhism originated from Hinduism, also containing Hinduism's traditions."
487,锡克教徒把自己的宗教称为 Gurmat，在旁遮普语中是“古鲁（导师）之路”的意思。古鲁是所有印度宗教的基本组成部分，但在锡克教中地位特别高，成为了锡克教信仰的核心。,"Sikhs call their own religion Gurmat, in Punjabi is the meaning of 古鲁 (老师) 之路──古鲁 is the basic constituent part of all Indian religions, but it has a particularly high status in Sikhism, becoming the core of Sikhism."
488,该宗教于 15 世纪由古鲁·纳纳克 (1469-1539) 创立。随后又有九位古鲁。,The religion was founded in the 15th century by Kṛṣṇa Nagarak (1469-1539) and was followed by nine other Kṛṣṇas.
489,然而，在 1956 年 6 月，当波兰工人抗议食品短缺和减薪的骚乱演变成对共产主义制度本身的抗议时，赫鲁晓夫的承诺面临着考验。,"However, in June 1956, when protests by Polish workers against food shortages and wage cuts turned into protests against the communist system itself, Herrushov's commitment was put to the test."
490,尽管在最后，赫鲁晓夫派出坦克恢复了秩序，但他还是对一些经济要求做出了让步，并同意任命受民众欢迎的瓦迪斯瓦夫·哥穆尔卡 (Wladyslaw Gomulka) 为新总理。,"Although in the end, Khrushchev dispatched tanks to restore order, he still made concessions to some economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Vadislav Gomulka (Wladyslaw Gomulka) as the new prime minister."
491,印度河流域文明是青铜时代的文明，位于印度西北部次大陆，覆盖的区域包括了现代巴基斯坦的大部分地区，以及印度西北部和阿富汗东北部的一些地区。,"The Indian river region civilization is a civilization of the Bronze Age, located in the northwestern subcontinent of India, covering most of modern Pakistan, as well as some areas of northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan."
492,印度河盆地的文明发展繁荣，该文明因此得名。,"印度河盆地 civilization development flourished, this civilization thus gained its name."
493,尽管一些学者推测，鉴于这一文明也存在于如今已然干涸的萨拉斯瓦蒂河流域，将该文明称为“印度河-萨拉斯瓦蒂河文明”才算恰如其分，不过一些人称其为“哈拉帕文明”——得名于20世纪20年代在该区域发掘的第一个遗址“哈拉帕”。,"Although some scholars suggest, given that this civilization also exists in the now-defunct Saraswati river basin, that civilization will be called the Indian River-Saraswati River civilization, but some call it the Harappa civilization, which gained its name from the first site excavated in the region in the 1920s."

511,这些孩子往往会陷入很多麻烦。因为正常的方法无法刺激他们的大脑，为了刺激大脑，他们“做出危险行为、打架、挑战权威”。,"These children tend to get into a lot of trouble. Because normal methods do not stimulate their brains, in order to stimulate their brains, they engage in dangerous behaviour, fight, challenge authority."
512,注意力缺陷障碍（ADD）会影响患病孩童与其同龄人的关系，因为其他儿童无法理解患者做出行为、进行拼写的原因所在，也不理解为什么他们的成熟程度与众不同。,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD) affects the relationship between sick children and their peers, because other children cannot understand the reasons for the patient's behaviour, or why their maturity level differs from that of others."
513,当获取知识和进行学习的能力发生如上所述的变化时，获取知识的基本速率也相应地产生变化。,"When there is a change in the acquisition of knowledge and the ability to learn as described above, the basic rate of acquisition of knowledge also corresponds to change."

564,只有杞人忧天思维的影响，而不是沮丧和恐惧的影响，才能有条件地每周定期进行结构性体育锻炼。,"Only the effects of human worries and thoughts, rather than the effects of loss and fear, can be conditioned to carry out structural physical exercises regularly every week."
565,参与定期训练的人在对疼痛的被动感知方面需要更多支持，以帮助他们区分慢性疼痛和不适感与正常身体运动的区别。,People who participate in regular training need more support in their passive perception of pain to help them distinguish between chronic pain and discomfort and normal body movement.
566,视觉或看的能力依赖于视觉系统的感觉器官，即眼睛。,"The ability to see or see depends on the sensory organs of the visual system, i.e. the eyes."
567,眼睛的构造有许多种，其复杂程度取决于生物体的需要。,"There are many types of eye structures, the complexity of which depends on the needs of the organism."

572,行军蚁群的行进和筑巢也分不同的阶段。,There are also different stages in the development and construction of the nest.
573,在迁徙阶段，行军蚁在夜间出行，白天停下来安营。,"During the migration phase, the troops went out in the night, the day stopped coming in and out."
574,当可利用的食物减少时，这个蚁群就会迎来迁徙期。在这一阶段，蚁群会建造每天更换的临时巢穴。,"When the availability of food decreases, this group will embark on a migration period. At this stage, the group will build temporary nests for daily change."
575,这种游牧性的横冲直撞行为每次都会持续 17 天左右。,This kind of wildlife-related collision will continue for 17 days or so.

602,另一个例子是水。化合物水是由两个氢原子和一个氧原子组成的。,Another example is water. Water is a compound composed of two atoms and one oxygen atom.
603,无论是气体、液体还是固体，它的分子结构都是一样的。,"Whether it is gas, liquid or solid, its molecular structure is the same."
604,虽然它的物理状态可能会改变，但化学状态保持不变。,"Although its physical state may change, its chemical state remains unchanged."
605,时间就在我们身边，影响着我们做的每一件事，但却很难理解。,"Time is all around us, affecting everything we do, but it's hard to understand."
606,数千年来，时间一直是宗教、哲学和科学学者的研究对象。,"For thousands of years, time has been the subject of study by religious, philosophical and scientific scholars."

614,然后该理论确立了这样一种观点：毛利人从波利尼西亚乘“大船”迁移，并从莫里奥里人手中夺取了新西兰，建立了一个农业社会。,"Then the theory established this view: the Māori people migrated from Polynesia by large ships, and captured New Zealand from the Māori people, establishing an agricultural society."
615,但有新的证据表明，莫里奥里人属于大陆毛利人族群，他们从新西兰移居到查塔姆群岛，发展出了自己独特的崇尚和平的文化。,"But there is new evidence that the Moriori people belonged to the mainland Māori people, who moved from New Zealand to Chatham Islands, developing their own unique culture of noble peace."
616,查塔姆群岛上还有另一个部落，他们是从新西兰移民过来的毛利人。,"There is another tribe on the Chatham Islands, they are Māori people who have immigrated from New Zealand."
617,他们自称莫里奥里人。发生过一些小冲突，最后莫里奥里人被消灭了,"They call themselves Moriori people. There have been some small conflicts, and the last Moriori people have disappeared."
618,参与了几十年的人士帮助我们认识到自己的长处和热情所在，同时坦诚地评估困难，甚至是失败。," participating people for decades helped us recognize our own strengths and warmth, while honestly evaluating difficulties, even failures "
619,在听取别人分享他们个人、家庭和组织的故事时，我们对过去以及一些对组织文化有或好或坏影响的人物有了宝贵的认识。,"When listening to others share their personal, family and organizational stories, we have a valuable knowledge of the past as well as of some people who have had a positive or negative impact on organizational culture."
620,虽然理解历史并不意味着理解文化，但至少可以帮助人们了解自己在组织历史中的位置。,"Although understanding history does not mean understanding culture, it can at least help people understand their place in organizational history."
621,在总结成功和失败时，个人和所有参与者会对组织的价值观、使命和驱动力有更深刻的认识。,"In the context of overall success and failure, individuals and all participants will have a deeper understanding of the values, mission and driving forces of the organization."
622,在这种情况下，回顾之前的创业行为和取得的成功可以帮助人们对当地教会的新变化和新方向保持开放的态度。,"In this case, reconsidered entrepreneurial behaviour and achievements can help people to remain open to new changes and new directions in the local church."
623,这样的成功故事让人们对变化的恐惧感减轻了，同时为未来的变革营造出正面的倾向。,"This kind of success story eases people's fear of change, while creating a positive tendency for future change."
624,收敛思维模式是通过结合不同的想法或领域来寻找解决方案的问题解决技巧。,收思维模式 is a method of solving problems by combining different ideas or fields to find solutions.
625,这种思维模式看重的是速度、逻辑和准确性，还有甄别事实、对现有技术的重新应用和信息收集。,"This type of thinking focuses on speed, logic and accuracy, as well as other facts regarding the re-application and collection of information of existing technologies."
626,这种思维模式最重要的因素是：正确答案只有一个。你只需考虑两个答案，即对的或者是错的。,"This type of thinking is the most important factor: the correct answer is only one. You only need to consider two answers, namely yes or wrong."
627,这种思维模式与某些科学或标准程序不无关联。,This type of thinking is unrelated to certain scientific or standard procedures.
628,这种思维类型的人具有逻辑思维，能够记得住模式、解决问题，还能进行科学测试。,"This type of thinking people have logical thinking, are able to remember living patterns, solve problems, and also can conduct scientific tests."
629,到目前为止，人类是最善于读懂他人心思的物种。,"So far, humans are the best-read species of other people's minds."
630,这意味着我们能够成功地预测其他人的感知、意图、信仰、知识或欲望。,"This means that we are able to successfully predict other people's perceptions, intentions, beliefs, knowledge or desires."
631,在这些能力中，理解他人意图至关重要。我们可以凭借这一能力理解身体行为可能表达出的模棱两可的问题。,"Among these abilities, understanding other people's intentions is essential. We can use this ability to understand the ways in which bodily behaviour can be expressed."

896,鞋纹应该足够深，在5 毫米（1/5英寸）或以上；材料应在低温下足够柔软。,"鞋纹 should be sufficiently deep, in 5 毫米 ((1/5英寸) or above; material should be sufficiently soft at low temperature。"
897,有的靴子有鞋钉；也有为湿滑路面设计的、带有鞋钉的扩展装备，适用于大多数鞋子和靴子，能装在鞋跟上，或同时装在鞋跟和鞋底上。,"Some boots have shoe nails; there is also an extension equipment designed for wet slippery roads, suitable for most shoes and boots, which can be mounted on the shoe nails, or at the same time mounted on the shoe nails and the bottom of the shoes."
898,鞋跟应该低而宽。道路上经常会撒上细沙、砂石或盐粒（氯化钙），以增加摩擦力。,"The shoe should be low and wide. On the road, the shoe often sits on the sand, sandstone or salt grains to increase the friction force."
899,雪崩并不是异常现象；陡坡上所能容纳的雪量有限，多余的雪就会以雪崩的形式坠落。,"Snowfall is not an unusual phenomenon; the amount of snow on the slopes is limited, the excess snow will fall in the form of snowfall."
900,问题是雪有很强的粘性。因此需要一些触发因素才能降雪，而有一点雪落下来也可能触发其他的雪下降。,"The problem is that snow has a very strong viscosity. So it takes some triggers to make snow fall, while one snowfall may also trigger other snowfall."
901,有时起初的触发原因是太阳让雪变暖，有时是因为降雪多了些，有时是因为其他自然事件，但更常见的原因往往是人为因素。,"Sometimes the initial trigger is because the sun warms up the snow, sometimes it's because there's more snow, sometimes it's because of other natural events, but the more common causes are usually human-caused."
902,龙卷风是一股气压极低的旋转气流柱，它能将周围的空气向内、向上吸入。,"龙卷风 (龙卷风) is a rotating low-pressure airflow column, it can absorb the surrounding air inwards, upwards."
903,龙卷风会产生强风（常常每小时 100-200 英里），能把重物抛到空中，并裹挟着它们向前移动。,"龙卷风会产生强风(常常每小时100-200英里), can throw heavy objects into the air, and wrapped them in forward motion。"
904,刚开始时，漏斗状云从雷暴云中向下伸展，当它们接触地面时就变成了“龙卷风”。,"刚开始时,漏斗状云从雷暴云中向下伸展, when they come into contact with the ground, they become 龙卷风."
905,个人 VPN（虚拟专用网络）程序是规避政治审查和商业 IP 地理过滤的绝佳工具。,个人VPN (虚拟专用网络) is an excellent tool for avoiding political censorship and commercial IP geography.
906,它们优于网页代理的原因如下：它们重新路由所有互联网流量，而不仅仅是超文本传送协议 (http) 内容。,"它们优于网页代理的原因如下: they re-route through all Internet traffic, not just over-text transmission protocol (http) 内容──"
907,它们通常会提供更高的带宽和更优质的服务。它们经过加密，更难被监视。,They usually provide a higher bandwidth and better quality of service.
908,媒体公司照例撒谎以掩盖其目的，声称这是为了“防止盗版”。,"The media company, for example, lied to cover up its purpose, claiming it was to prevent theft."
909,事实上，区域码对非法复制毫无影响；一份逐位拷贝的磁盘副本在任何可以播放原盘的设备上都可以顺利播放。,"In fact, the regional code has no effect on illegal copying; a one-by-one copy of the disk copy can be played smoothly on any device on the original disc."
910,实际上的目的是为了让这些公司更好地控制他们的市场；一切都是为了圈钱。,The real aim is to make these companies better control their markets; everything is for the sake of money.
911,因为呼叫是通过互联网路由的，因此你不必使用位于你居住地或旅行地点的通话公司。,"Because calling is via the Internet, you don't have to use the phone company located in your residence or travel location."
912,是否在居住的社区获得本地号码，这点没有要求；你可以在阿拉斯加奇金的野外获得卫星互联网连接，然后选一个号码，显示你位于阳光明媚的亚利桑那州。,"Whether you get a local number in the residential community, that's not required; you can get a satellite Internet connection outdoors in Alaska, and then choose a number that shows you're located in the sunny state of Arizona."
913,很多时候，你必须单独购买一个可以在全球使用的号码，这样才能接听来自公共交换电话网 (PSTN) 电话的呼叫。该号码的来源地对主叫方有很大影响。,"很多时候, you have to buy a number that can be used globally, so that you can listen to calls from the public switched telephone network (PSTN)."
914,实时文本翻译应用：能够自动将整段文本从一种语言转换成另一种语言的应用程序。,实时文本翻译应用:能够自动将整段文本从一种语言转换到另一种语言的应用程序. 实时文本翻译应用:能够自动将整段文本从一种语言转换到另一种语言的应用程序.
915,某些此类应用程序甚至让用户把智能手机对着现实世界中的标志或其他物体，就能翻译上面的外语文字。,Some such applications even allow users to use their smart phones to translate the above foreign words into signs or other objects in the real world.
916,翻译引擎有了显著的改进，现在经常提供或多或少正确的翻译（而更多情况是很少有胡言乱语），但需要注意的是，他们仍然可能会完全翻错。,"Translation engines have made significant improvements, now often providing more or less correct translations, and more often there are few, but it should be noted that they may still completely overwrite errors."
917,一个最杰出的此类应用是谷歌翻译。在下载所需语言数据后，它可以进行离线翻译。,"One of the most outstanding applications of this type is Google Translate. After downloading the required language data, it can be translated offline."
918,出国旅行时，使用智能手机 GPS 导航应用可能是最简单方便的导航方式。,"When travelling abroad, using a smart phone GPS navigation application may be the simplest and most convenient navigation method."
919,比起够买带 GPS 的地图或独立的 GPS 设备，或者是从汽车租赁公司租一个，这种方式更省钱。,"Better than buying a GPS map or an independent GPS device, or renting one from a car rental company, this method is more economical."
920,如果你的手机没有数据连接，或者不在服务范围，手机的性能可能会受限，或者无法使用手机。,"If your phone does not have a data connection, or is not within the scope of the service, the performance of the phone may be limited, or it may not be able to use the phone."
921,每个街头小店都摆满了一排令人眼花缭乱的预付费电话卡，这些电话卡既可以用于公用付费电话机，也可以用于普通电话机。,"Every street in the small shop is packed with a row of eye-catching prepaid phone cards, which can be used for both public pay phone machines and ordinary telephone machines."
922,尽管大多数电话卡适合给任何地方打电话，但有些卡在拨打一些特定国家的电话时有特别优惠。,"Although most telephone cards are suitable for calling anywhere, some cards have special advantages when calling certain countries."
923,通常拨打一个电话号码即可获取这些服务，而大多数的电话都可免费拨打该串号码。,"Usually, a telephone number is available to access these services, while most calls are available for free."
924,有关常规摄影的规则也适用于录像，甚至可能更适用。,"Regular photography rules also apply to videos, even possibly more applicable."
925,如果连拍照都不允许的话，就更不用想拍摄视频了。,"If you don't want to take pictures, you don't have to take pictures."
926,如果使用无人机，请提前仔细确认可以拍摄的内容，以及需要哪些许可或额外的牌照。,"If using an unmanned machine, please confirm in advance what can be photographed, as well as what licenses or additional licenses are required."
927,在机场附近或人群拥挤的地方操控无人机升空，是个馊主意，即使这在你所在地区并不违法。,"Operating in crowded places near the airport is a personal idea, even if it's not illegal in your area."
928,现在已经很少有人不先搜索和比较价格，就直接通过航空公司订票了。,"Currently very few people do not search and compare prices, just directly through the airline ordered tickets."
929,有时，同一航班在不同信息汇集网站上的价格可能相差很大，在预订前先比较搜索结果，同时看看航空公司自己的网站，是有好处的。,"Sometimes, the same flight may differ greatly in price on different information gathering websites, in pre-booking comparison search results, while also looking at the airline's own website, is advantageous."
930,尽管短期访问某些国家时，旅游或商务出行并不需要签证，但留学生去那里的话，所待的时间通常需比休闲的游客要长。,"Although short-term visits to certain countries, tourism or business trips do not require a visa, students who go there usually wait longer than leisure travellers."
931,通常来说，较长时间停留在外国需要提前获取签证。,"Usually, a longer stay in a foreign country requires an advance visa."
932,与普通旅游签证或商务签证相比，学生签证通常有不同的要求和申请程序。,"Compared to ordinary tourist or business visas, student visas usually have different requirements and application procedures."
933,在大多数国家，你需要一份你希望就读的学校的录取通知书，以及证明你有至少第一年课程所需资金的文件。,"In most countries, you need an admission notice to the school you want to attend, as well as proof that you have at least the funds needed for the first year of classes."
934,咨询学校及你希望留学的国家的移民局，以了解详细要求。,"咨询学校及你希望留学的国家移民局, to understand the details of the requirements."
935,除非你是外交官，否则在海外工作一般需要向所在国家/地区缴纳所得税。,"Unless you are a diplomat, you are generally required to pay income tax to your country/region for work abroad."
936,国家不同，所得税的结构是不同的，税率和税率等级也有很大的差异。,"The structure of income tax varies from country to country, the tax rate and the tax rate are also very different."
937,一些联邦国家，比如美国和加拿大，会征收联邦和地方所得税，因此税率和等级可能因地区而异。,"Some federal states, such as the United States and Canada, will levy federal and local income taxes, so tax rates and levels may vary by region."
938,在回到本国时通常不需要进行入境检查或者只是走走形式，但过海关可能会很麻烦。,"When returning home, there is usually no need to carry out a check-in or just a walk-in form, but transit can be very difficult."
939,确保知晓可以携带什么，不能携带什么，并申报任何超出法律允许的物件。,"Make sure you know what you can carry, what you can't carry, and declare anything beyond the law."
940,开始旅行写作最简单的方法就是在一个资深旅行博客网站上磨练你的技能。,The easiest way to start travel writing is to hone your skills on a senior travel blog site.
941,熟悉网上排版和编辑后，你便可创建自己的网站。,"熟悉网上排版和编辑后,你便可创建自己的网站──"
942,在旅行中进行志愿服务是一种与众不同的好方法，但这不仅仅在于付出。,"Volunteering on a trip is a good way to meet people, but it's not just about paying."
943,在国外生活和做志愿者，是了解不同文化、结识新朋友、了解自我、锻炼正确判断的能力、甚至是获得新技能的好方法。,"In foreign life and volunteering, it is a good way to learn different cultures, meet new friends, learn about yourself, exercise the ability to judge correctly, and even acquire new skills."
944,这也是一个节省预算的好方法，可以在某处待更长时间，因为很多志愿者工作提供食宿，有些工作还有少量工资。,"This is also a good way to save on budget, you can stay longer somewhere, because many volunteer jobs provide lodging, some jobs have less wages."
945,维京人利用俄罗斯水路到达黑海和里海。其中一些路线至今仍可通行。确认一下是否需要特殊许可证，这些许可证可能很难申请。,维京人利用俄罗斯水路到黑海和里海. Some of these routes are still operational.
946,白令海峡经由奥内加湖（Lake Onega）、拉多加湖（Lake Ladoga）和圣彼得堡（Saint Petersburg）连接北冰洋和波罗的海，连接处多数是河流和湖泊。,白令海峡经由奥内加湖 (奥内加湖) 拉多加湖 (拉多加湖) 拉多加湖 (拉多加湖) 拉多加湖 (拉多加湖) 拉多加湖 (拉多加湖) 拉多加湖) 拉多加湖 (拉多加湖) 拉多加湖 (拉多加湖) 拉多加湖 (拉多加湖) 拉多加湖 (拉多加湖) 拉多加湖 (拉多加湖) 拉多加湖
947,奥内加湖 (Lake Onega) 也与伏尔加河 (Volga) 连接，因此可能可以从里海 (Caspian Sea) 经俄罗斯到达这里。,"Ó内加湖 (Lake Onega) is also connected to Volga River (Volga), so it is possible to get here from里海 (Caspian Sea) 经俄罗斯到达这里──"
948,请放心，在到达码头后，一切都会顺其自然。你会遇到其他要搭便船的人，他们会与你分享信息。,"Please be assured, after arriving at the docks, everything will go according to nature. You will meet other people on board, they will share information with you."
949,基本上，你可以张贴告示，告知他人你可以提供帮助、在码头上来回走动、接触正在清理游艇的人或酒吧里的水手等等。,"Basically, you can post an advertisement, tell others you can offer help, come and go on the dock, contact someone cleaning a yacht or a waterman in a bar, etc."
950,试着和尽可能多的人聊天。过一段时间，每个人都会认识你，他们会提示你哪条船在找人。,"Try and talk to as many people as possible. After a while, everyone will know you, they will tell you which ship is looking for someone."
951,你务必谨慎选择联盟中的”飞行常客“航空公司。,You've got to be cautious about choosing an airline.
952,虽然你可能会认为，乘坐哪家航空公司航班的次数最多就加入哪家航空公司的会员是很自然的事，但你应该知道，航空公司提供的权益往往不同，同一联盟下的其他航空公司可能会回馈更多常旅客积分。,"Although you may think that it is natural for members of which airline to join the most frequent flights, you should know that the rights offered by the airline are often different, other airlines under the same union may return more regular passenger points."
953,诸如阿联酋航空公司、阿提哈德航空公司、卡塔尔航空公司和土耳其航空公司之类的航司已经大大扩展了对非洲的服务业务，提供了飞往非洲许多主要城市的航线，价格也比其他欧洲航空公司更有竞争力。,"Airlines such as the United Arab Emirates, Altihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have greatly expanded their service business in Africa, providing flights to many of Africa's major cities, and pricing is also more competitive than other European airlines."
954,从 2014 年开始，土耳其航空公司可到达 30 个非洲国家的 39 个目的地。,"Since 2014, Turkish Airlines has reached 39 destinations in 30 African countries."
955,如果你的旅行时间有富余，请查看前往非洲的总票价跟环球旅行票价的比较情况。,"If your travel time is over, please check the comparison of the total fare prices for travel to Africa with the global fare prices."
956,对于非洲以外的所有地区，别忘了加上额外的签证费、离境税、地面交通等费用。,"For all regions outside Africa, do not forget the additional visa fee, exit tax, ground transport etc."
957,如果你只想在南半球范围内坐飞机环游世界，航班和目的地的选择都十分有限，因为跨洋航线很少。,"If you only want to fly around the world in the Southern Hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations is very limited, because there are very few transatlantic routes."
958,南半球没有一家航空联盟的航线能横跨全部三个大洋（天合联盟甚至没有跨洋航线）。,The Southern Hemisphere does not have a single airline that can cross all three continents.
959,然而，星空联盟涵盖了全球各条航线，不过从智利的圣地亚哥到塔希提岛的东南太平洋航线除外，这是南美航空 (LATAM) 寰宇一家航空公司的航线。,"However, the Star-Air Alliance covers various global routes, with the exception of the East-South Pacific route from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which is the route of South American Airways (LATAM) 宇一家航空公司."

961,1994 年，阿塞拜疆的亚美尼亚族纳戈尔诺—卡拉巴赫地区向阿塞拜疆人发动了战争。,"In 1994, Azerbaijan's Armenian tribe Nagorno-Karabakh region started a war against the Azerbaijanis."
962,在亚美尼亚的支持下，一个新共和国诞生了。然而，它没有得到任何国家（包括亚美尼亚）的正式承认。,"Under the support of Armenia, a new republic was born. However, it was not officially recognized by any country (including Armenia)."

966,五渔村（Cinque Terre），原意为五块土地，由位于意大利利古里亚（Liguria）地区的五座沿海小村庄 Riomaggiore、Manarola、Corniglia、Vernazza 和 Monterosso 组成。,"Five fishing villages (Cinque Terre), originally intended for five blocks of land, are five along the coast of the Ligurian region: Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso."
967,它们被列入了联合国教科文组织世界遗产名录。,They are included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.
968,几个世纪以来，人们在崎岖陡峭的地形上精心建造梯田，这些山坡一直延伸到俯瞰大海的悬崖峭壁。,"For centuries, people have been careful to build terraces on rough terrain, these hillsides have been extending to the cliffs overlooking the sea."
969,它的魅力部分在于没有明显的企业发展。村庄靠道路、火车和船只连接起来，开车无法从外面到达这些村庄。,"Part of its charm lies in the lack of obvious business development. The villages are connected by road, train and boat, and the vehicles cannot reach these villages from the outside."
970,比利时和瑞士使用的法语语种与法国使用的法语尽管非常相似，可以互通，但还是稍有不同。,"Although very similar, it is possible to communicate with each other, but still slightly different."
971,具体说来，比利时和瑞士讲的法语在数字系统上有一些细微的特殊性，与法国讲的法语不同，一些单词的发音也略有不同。,"Specifically, the French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland have some minor peculiarities in the digital system, unlike the French spoken in France, the pronunciation of some words is also slightly different."
972,不过，所有说法语的比利时人和瑞士人都会在学校里学习标准法语，所以即使您使用标准的法国度量系统，他们也能听得懂。,"However, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss people will learn Standard French in schools, so even if you use the standard French measurement system, they can also hear it."
973,在世界上许多地方，挥手是一种友好的表示，意思是“你好”。,"In many places in the world, waving is a kind of friendly expression, meaning ""you're good""."
974,但是，在马来西亚，至少在农村地区的马来人中，这个手势类似于在某些西方国家用食指朝自己身体摆动，表示“过来”，并且这个手势仅用来表示这个意思。,"However, in Malaysia, at least among the Malays in rural areas, this gesture is similar in some western countries to using the finger to swing their body, indicating 过来, and this gesture is only used to express this meaning."
975,同样，挥手告别时，如果掌心向着挥手者自己（而不是向着要挥别的人），身处西班牙的英国游客可能会误以为这是请人回来的手势。,"Similarly, when waving farewell, if the hand is directed to the waving person himself, rather than to someone else, the British tourist in Spain may mistakenly think that this is a gesture to invite people back."
976,辅助语言是为了便于语言不相通的人群交流而创造的人工语言或构造语言。,辅助语言 is the creation of an artificial language or constructive language in order to facilitate interpersonal communication between different languages.

978,在白天最热的时候，旅行者们可以体验到由水（或其他东西）所形成的错觉——海市蜃楼。,"During the hottest times of the day, travelers can experience the mistakes made by water or other things."
979,旅行者追逐海市蜃楼会十分危险，因为会浪费宝贵的精力和剩余的水。,"Travelers chasing the seashore will be very dangerous, because it will waste precious energy and remaining water."
980,即使是最炎热的沙漠，夜间也会变得极其寒冷。如果没有保暖的衣服，低体温症是真实存在的风险。,"Even in the hottest desert, the night also becomes extremely cold. If there is no warm clothing, low body temperature is a real risk."
981,尤其在夏天，如果你决定徒步穿越雨林，就需要小心蚊子。,"Especially in the summer, if you decide to walk through the rainforest, you need little mosquitoes."
982,如果您正在开车穿越亚热带雨林，在您进入车内时车门敞开的几秒钟时间里，也足以让蚊子与您一起钻进车里。,"If you are driving through a tropical rainforest, within a few seconds of entering the car when the door opens, it is enough to let mosquitoes enter the car with you."
983,禽流感，或更正式地称之为 “家禽流行性感冒”，既能感染鸟类，又能感染哺乳动物。,"禽流感, or more formally called 家禽流行性感冒, is both an infectious disease affecting birds, and an infectious disease affecting mammals."
984,据报道，人类感染禽流感的病例不到 一千例，但其中有一些病例是致命的。,"According to reports, there are fewer than 1,000 cases of human infection with avian influenza, but some cases are fatal."
985,大多数病例出自与家禽打交道的人群，但观鸟者也有一定风险。,"The majority of cases occur in people who interact with poultry, but birdwatchers also have a certain risk."
986,挪威的典型地貌，是陡峭的峡湾和山谷突然变成了高大的、多多少少无甚起伏的高原。,"The typical landscape of Norway is that the canyon and valley suddenly became a high-altitude, more or less uplifting highland."
987,这些高原通常被称为 “vidde”，意思是广阔的、开放的、没有树木的空间，是一片浩瀚无垠的区域。,"These highlands are usually called vidde, meaning wide, open, treeless space, a piece of 无的区域."
988,在罗加兰和阿格德，它们被俗称为“hei”，意思是没有树木的荒野，通常长满石南。,"In Rogaland and Agde, they are commonly called hei, meaning treeless wilderness, usually长满石南。"
989,冰川并不是稳定的，而会从山上流下来。这会导致出现裂缝和冰裂隙，而这些裂隙可能会被雪桥掩盖。,"The glacier is not stable, but flows down from the mountains. This leads to cracks and ice crevices, which may be covered by snow."
990,冰洞的墙壁和屋顶可能会坍塌，裂缝可能会闭合。,"Walls and roofs of ice holes may collapse, cracks may close."
991,在冰川的边缘，巨大的冰块会松动、掉落，也许还会跳到或滚到离边缘更远的地方。,"On the edge of the glacier, huge ice blocks will melt, fall, maybe even jump up or roll away from the edge further away."
992,山中避暑之地的旅游旺季通常是在印度的夏季。,The tourist season in the Himalayas is usually in the Indian summer season.
993,然而，冬天却另有一番不同的美景和魅力，许多山中避暑之地的雪量恰到好处。这些地方会提供活动项目，例如滑雪和滑板滑雪。,"However, in winter there are also different sceneries and charms, the snowfall in many mountainous ski resorts is quite good. These places will offer activities such as skiing and snowboarding."
994,只有少数几家航空公司扔提供丧亲票价，这比为赶赴葬礼的临时出行稍微便宜一些。,"Only a handful of airlines were offering death tickets, which were slightly cheaper than for a temporary trip to the funeral."
995,提供此类票价的航空公司包括加拿大航空公司、达美航空公司、德国汉莎航空公司（从美国或加拿大起飞的航班）以及西捷航空公司。,"Airlines that offer this type of ticket price include Canadian Airlines, Da美航空, Deutsche Hansha Airlines (flights departing from the United States or Canada) and WestJet Airways."
996,无论情况如何，你都必须直接打电话向航空公司订票。,"In any case, you must make a direct phone call to the airline."
